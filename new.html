                      <h2 class="description">Onitama is an elegant and simple game
                      which captures the essence of martial arts.
                      Each game is quick, usually 15 minutes
                      in length.</h2>
                    <br>
                      <h2 class="rule-subtitle">Setup</h2>
                    <br>
                      <p>The player chooses 5 pawns of one color (1 master + 4 students). 
                        The Master pawn is placed on the temple arch nearest them,
                        and their 4 Student pawns on the 2 squares on either side of the master.
                        Two random cards are given to each player, face up — this is the player’s
                        “hand”. 
                        <br><br>
                        One more Move card is revealed, and the stamp in the lower
                        right hand corner of the card is used to determine the starting player.
                        This card is placed so that it is on the right side of the
                        game play area. The rest of the Move cards will not be used.
                      </p>
                    <br>
                      <h2 class="rule-subtitle">How do I Win?</h2>
                    <br>
                      <p>It is important to explain how to win before any other movement. This way you can
                        associate the movement with strategy to win. There are two ways to prove that your 
                        Art is stronger — the Way of the Stone or the Way of the Stream.
                      </p>
                      <br>
                        <ul>
                        <li> To win in the Way of the Stone, you must capture your opponent’s Master pawn.</li>
                        <li> To win in the Way of the Stream, you must move your own Master pawn into your opponent’s Temple Arch space.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                      <h2 class="rule-subtitle">How do I Play?</h2>
                      <br>
                        <p>Combat in Onitama is simple and elegant, as befits a contest between two Masters. You and
                          your opponent will take turns following the two steps below, one for the body, one for the spirit.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                          <ul>
                            <li>Step 1, Move and Attack<br>
                              On your turn, examine and choose one of the two Move cards in front of you. Then, move one
                              of your pawns (student or master) as shown on that card. (The square grid will show you
                              the way.)
                              <br><br>
                              The black square in the middle represents the space your chosen pawn occupies. The colored
                              spaces show where your pawn can move, relative to its starting position. You can move your pawn
                              to any one of the spaces indicated. Other pawns (yours or your opponents) and Temple Arches do 
                              not block the movement of your pawn across the play area.
                              <br><br>
                              If your pawn moves onto a square that is occupied by one of your opponent’s pawns, the
                              opponent’s pawn is “captured” and removed from the game.
                              You must actually land on the piece to capture it — moving over or through a square occupied by
                              an opponent’s piece does not capture it. 
                            </li>
                            <br>
                            <li>Step 2, Exchange Cards <br>
                              The move card you just used, will be placed to the left side of the playmat.
                              Then the card that is on the right side of the play area will be added to your hand. You may
                              use that card starting next turn, as one of the two move cards you can choose from. 
                              <br><br>
                              Now it is time for your opponent to take a turn, following the same two steps.
                              You shall continue to take turns until one of you has won the game, demonstrating mastery of
                              your Martial Art. 
                            </li>
                          </ul>
                          <br><br>
                      <h2 class="rule-subtitle">What if I don't want to move?</h2>
                      <br>
                          <p>If you have a legal move, you must take it—even if you don’t want to! Be careful that
                            your opponent does not trap you in a position from which you cannot escape.
                            It is possible that you will find that you cannot use any of your cards to make a
                            legal move. If this happens —and only then— you must pass your turn. None of
                            your pawns will move. But like the river that constantly flows, you cannot remain
                            unchanged: you must still choose one of the two cards in front of you to be placed to the
                            left of the play area, and receive the card from the right of the play area.
                          </p>
